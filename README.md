dotfiles
========

Seeing that sharing dotfiles is the new trend, here are mine.

## Linux distro

I use Arch + OpenBox

## Xresources / bashrc

The colors are inspired from the *ColorBrewer* project, and written as a
resource file for `base16`. The `PS1` gives the current directory and (if
this is a `git` repo) the state of the files.

![term theme](https://raw.github.com/tpoisot/dotfiles/master/img/dotfiles.png)

The monospace font in *Andale Mono*.

## conkyrc

Nothing fancy here. The uptime, battery remaining, and current use for each
CPU, along with the top 5 processes.

## tint2rc

Two taskbars for the two openbox desktops, and that's about it.
