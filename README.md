dotfiles
========

Seeing that sharing dotfiles is the new trend, here are mine.

The `Xresources` theme is based on [FlatUI colors][fuc], and most of the code
is lifted directly from [Chris Kempson's `base16`][ckb16]. The `PS1` is
extremely minimal, with an indicator of whether the last command succeeded, and
that's it (the full path is stored in the window title bar).

The `flat.vim` color scheme is largely a work in progress, and notably the
`gvim` theme is *not* what it's supposed to be (because I use terminal `vim`).
